# Vibe Coding For Journalists
*Build Real AI-Powered Tools Without Writing Code*

A workshop for [ONA25](https://ona25.journalists.org/) by [Liam Andrew](https://www.github.com/mailbackwards/) and [Ryan Restivo](https://www.github.com/ryanrestivo/).

### Welcome to the Repo for this ONA25 Session!

## Intro
What are you thinking about when you think of vibe coding? What ideas come to mind? What associations do you have with it?

### What you need
ChatGPT, Claude, Firebase Studio, Your Computer

### What is it good for?
> **Ryan:** In the very early days of the baseball stat "WAR", I remember Rick Peterson - the longtime pitching coach for the A's and then Mets - who was guesting on a few digital TV shows I was working on said, "What is it good for?!"... but vibe coding is different than that and it can help you with more than "absolutely nothin'".

#### Building quick stuff
>You probably can't make a 7-figure business off of "vibe coding". Most of those demos you see are facades. 
>🤣 “We are not building the app to save local news in the next 90 minutes, sorry to everyone who wanted to do that.”
>Good for formulas, scripts, regex and one-off problems.
>> If you don’t trust AI to do a job, you can still trust it to build something to do it
> Journalism values - we need to be **sure** and **know** what we’re talking about.
Accuracy is the _highest standard_. Vibe coding could be great to create “quick projects”, but by no means are we saying strip down your entire developer team and vibe build everything. **You need to know how it works!**

> **Ryan:** My example - building YESEO into 6 microservices from 1 giant app in early 2025. I needed to:
1. Create new services for each item as their own app
2. Build yaml files for each new Docker image (once they work)
3. Confirm they work in k8's
4. Hook them into the current app and make sure they work **EXACTLY** as they did before
5. Try them!!

*but all of this took a week to do!*

I can't give a user anything until **I know it works and how it works…** I used vibe coding to learn to connect my Docker images into creating yaml files that will work, but I still needed to move it every inch of the way to get it to production. And a lot of the time, I needed to improve the yaml.

**How do I know it works?!** I've checked it! but I still needed to do things like nginx and work in Squarespace to make the endpoints HTTPS. I have a whole SOP document on how to create these for my work in the future, should I ever need to make another.

### Scenarios
We've taken what we've learned and built stuff for you already so you can see how this can help with quick reporting. 

- [Weather data](weather_data) - Take a PDF report from NOAA on Louisiana's history of Hurricanes and turn it into a story, graphics and a game.
- [990 querier](990_querier) - How to create a script that will create a data viz for any 990s
- [High schools](high_schools) - How to turn data from US News & World Report's top high schools into interactive graphics and games people can use.
- [ONA Quest](ona_quest) - How to make a fun interactive game using Claude Artifacts.

### Scenario Enactment
- Try these or think of your own ideas with these in mind?
- How would you do the differently/the same?

#### Brainstorm
- Think of an idea you might want to do in the future after thinking about these.
- What is something you want to try early next week? Think of a problem or data or something you want to explore further.
- If you leave these docs with an idea to try **that's a win!**
