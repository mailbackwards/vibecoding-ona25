# Weather Data!

At first I wanted to reflect some smilar projects I've done in the past


Then I found this study of Louisiana hurricane history and thought this might be more relevant since (A) we are in New Orleans (B) the conference dates are the exact peak of Hurricane Season.

By all means read this 70 page paper, but lets

And so to get the data, yes I punched it into ChatGPT ðŸ¥´ to generate a CSV

I generated 3 CSVs, the historical data, the highest wind and total storms over decades. 

## Now Let's Vibe Code!

We can build a lot of stuff with this


Added this story to tell more narrative
